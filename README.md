__Apricot__ is a web application development library for C++. It tries to create a
simple yet effective way for programmers to create blazing fast websites in a natural way.

Being inspired by Node.js, we've tried to replicate most of the features in it. Like Node, it has a built in HTTP server that can be customized according to the users project environment (the developers can specify the serverâ€™s name, maximum number of requests, single threaded or multi-threaded and many more features).
